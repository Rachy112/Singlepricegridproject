## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- style-guide

### What I learned

what I learned while working on this project is the ability to think outside the box which helped me to solve some challenges i faced, and the ability to brainstorm with my collegues which bring the succes of this program. 
These are some codes that are of great samples and is a good way to reinforce my own knowledge.

```html
<p>HTML code I'm proud of</p>
<div>I'm so happy to have this HTML tag</div>
```
```css
.proudofthiscss {
  background-color: papayawhip;
  display: flex;
}
```

### Continued development

The areas i will like to continue focusing on include Cascading Style Sheets which describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen and other media and how it stand as a problem solver. CSS is wide and i will like to learn more about it.

### Useful resources
- [w3schools](https://www.W3schools.com) - This helped me with both CSS and HTML. I really liked the pattern and i will use it to learn more.
- [Scrimba](https://v2.scrimba.com) - This is an amazing video that explain both HTML and CSS ver well, which make coding more easy for me. I'd recommend it to anyone still learning this concept.
